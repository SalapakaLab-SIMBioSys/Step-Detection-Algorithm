This directory contains:


-------------------
two pairs of simulated files for seeing the input format &tryouts:
test_StepGro.txt :  regular stepped growth with noise
test_LinGro.txt : equal growth, with noise but without steps

test_Fakestepper1000.txt: random stepped growth with noise
test_Fakeline1000.txt: similar growth, with noise but without steps
--------------------

---------------------
The main programs& description:
Steps_Find.m
Steps_Evaluate.m
StepFindManual.doc
--------------------

---------------------
Extra programs:
-StepMaker.m : program by JWJ Kerssemakers that allows user to make simulated noisy step-tracks 
with known content, to evaluate the stepfinder-program

-stepfindercaller.m: program 03/31/07 by YJ SUN , Vale Lab : % 03/31/07 by YJ SUN: use Kerssemaker's 
stepfinder algorithm to fit individual stepping traces in a concatenated 
data set that has multiple traces.

pdf file with theory as described in the original paper: 
Supplemental material of 
Kerssemakers et al, Nature. 2006 Aug 10;442(7103):709-12), 
Assembly dynamics of microtubules at molecular resolution.
